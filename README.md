This is a photo manipulation program written in Java.
The purpose of this program is to modify the image's threshold (similar to photoshop).
This program also outputs the image's modified threshold into a text file.*

*Try editting the batman.txt file to see what I mean.

To run the file, first compile the code using the "ant" command to compile the jar file.
Once the jar file is compiled, it will be created as "Picture.jar"

To run it, in your command line, type:

java -jar Picture.jar <path/to/image> OR <url>
