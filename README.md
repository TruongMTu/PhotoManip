#Intro
This is a photo manipulation program written in Java.
The purpose of this program is to modify the image's threshold (similar to photoshop).
This program also outputs the image's modified threshold into a text file.*

*Try editting or looking at the batman.txt file to see what I mean.

##Running the Code

To run the file, first navigate to the folder where build.xml exists and compile the 
code using the "ant" command to compile the jar file. Once the jar file is compiled, 
it will be created as "Picture.jar" and a bin folder (you don't have to touch this).

To run it, in your command line, type:


java -jar Picture.jar **path/to/image** OR **url**
